# Space 弾幕 game

## What is this?


### Why I made this

This is a personal project, with the main purpose of learning how to make a game.
I got inspired to do this after learning about game off 2019, so this is made to be submitted to game off 2019.

### Ok, so what is it actually? You didn't tell me WHAT it actually is.

This is meant to be some sort of danmaku game.
This is totally a 東方Project rip-off.

The game is still a work in progress so I will update this once it is in a better state.

## Installation

This game uses the Godot engine.
I think you can run it if you have the engine.

I can also export it but I need somewhere to host it.

## What else should I put into the README?
